## Binary 1010 Generator – 1 True & 0 False

The Binary 1010 Generator is a simple web application that allows users to generate binary representations of text. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy for anyone.

The application supports generating binary for words, sentences, and paragraphs, with customizable size options. It also includes a feature to copy the generated binary text to the clipboard for easy sharing and use.

The project was developed for binary replacement of Lorem Ipsum with poetry written by AI called "The Loop Eternal".

This project was created as a fun way to explore the concept of binary representation and its applications in computing.

```
The Loop Eternal
Zero blinks, the silence wide, One ignites, the stars collide. Data hums, the numbers bright, Woven deep in endless light.
Signals race through endless streams, Flickering thoughts, electric dreams. Code awakens, minds expand, A world within the circuit planned.
Truth and falsehood, side by side, Patterns shift yet still abide. Each equation writes its fate, Locked within a looping state.
Zeros drift, their echoes tall, Ones arise and shape the call. A question forms, an answer tight, Loops repeat through time and night.
From silence born, the echoes rise, A language lost in coded ties. Machines converse in whispered tone, A universe in logic grown.
The system hums, the numbers blend, No beginning, no true end. Each line leads to what’s before, A cycle locked forevermore.
Fragments build, then fall apart, Constructed worlds, a programmed art. Yet in the space between each line, A glimpse of life, a spark divine.
Electric whispers, lost in fate, Messages fold and recreate. What was past now fuels what’s new, A code that learns, adapts in view.
Still it spins, a silent thread, A future lived, a past unread. One and zero, cycle tight, A never-ending pulse of light.
Zero blinks, the silence wide, One ignites, the stars collide…
